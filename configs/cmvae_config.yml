## THIS FILE CONTAINS ALL THE CMVAE PARAMETERS FOR TRAINING AND INFERENCE  ###
## GLOBAL
# Should we exclusively use cpu
use_cpu: False

## TRAINING ##
# Directory to the training set (contains state_data.csv and images directory)
train_dir: 'C:\Users\sambu\Documents\Repositories\CodeBases\SWiMM_DEEPeR\data\cmvae_training'

# Batch size
batch_size: 32

# Leanring Rate
learning_rate: 1e-4

# Number of features to encode down to
n_z: 10

# Should we use latent space constraints (i.e. CmvaeDirect)
latent_space_constraints: True

# Larger datasets may not have their tensors fit in RAM/VRAM, so instead generate the tensors per call per batch (reduces performance by ~60%)
load_during_training: True

# Maximum size of samples allowed to be taken from the training set
max_size: 10000

# Maximum number of epochs to run
epochs: 100

# How many epochs to monitor sufficient validation loss has been met for early stopping, with respect to loss_threshold. Set to ~ for no early stopping.
window_size: ~

# The minimum fracitonal gain required over window_size episodes to avoid early stopping
loss_threshold: 0.01

## INFERENCE ##
# Directory to the training set (contains state_data.csv and images directory)
