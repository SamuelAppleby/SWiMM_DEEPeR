## THIS FILE CONTAINS ALL THE TRAINING/INFERENCE PARAMETERS AND GYM ENVIRONMENT PARAMETERS  ###

## THE FOLLOWING ARE GLOBAL PARAMETERS  ###

# Observation type. CHOICES: 'image', 'vector', 'vae'
obs: 'vae'

# If you want to pass image observation through pretrained encoder, provide filepath, else pass empty string
vae_path: 'C:\Users\sambu\Documents\Repositories\CodeBases\SWiMM_DEEPeR\data\vae_training_set\64x64\cmvae_03-15-2023_nz_10\cmvae_model_49.ckpt'

# If using image obs, declare desired output size of scaling function
img_scale: !!python/tuple [64,64,3]

# Do we want to output the packet information and save images
debug_logs: False

### THE FOLLOWING ARE TRAINING PARAMETERS  ###

# Algorithm to import from Stable Baselines. CHOICES: 'sac', 'ddpg', 'ppo'
algo: 'sac'

# If you want to train on top of an existing model, provide filepath, else pass empty string
model_path: 'C:\Users\sambu\Documents\Repositories\CodeBases\SWiMM_DEEPeR\logs\sac\1\best_model.zip'

# Whether to save the Monitor logs generate by the Stable Baselines Monitor wrapper NOTE: False still writes but to tmp
monitor: True

# Whether to use Tensorboard NOTE: resulting event files are large
tb: True

# Used to express the optimal tracking position. This value is subtracted from the z-coordinate of the target's position
# i.e. how far set back from the target do you want the AUV to position itself
opt_d: 6

# At what radial distance should the episode terminate (FROM THE OPTIMAL TRACKING POSITION, NOT THE TARGET POSITION)
max_d: 4

# Override log interval
log_interval: 1

### THE FOLLOWING ARE INFERENCE PARAMETERS  ###

# Path to trained policy for performing inference
policy_path: 'C:\Users\sambu\Documents\Repositories\CodeBases\SWiMM_DEEPeR\Logs\sac\1\bestmodel.pkl'

# Path to where to create reward log csv as an output of inference run
reward_log_path: 'C:\Users\sambu\Documents\Repositories\CodeBases\SWiMM_DEEPeR\Logs\sac\1\inference.csv'

# Set seed with arbitrary int so that can report with results
seed: 31

# Episode length threshold. 0 means unlimited episode length.
ep_length_threshold: 3000
