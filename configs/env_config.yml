## THIS FILE CONTAINS ALL THE TRAINING/INFERENCE PARAMETERS AND GYM ENVIRONMENT PARAMETERS  ###
## THE FOLLOWING ARE GLOBAL PARAMETERS  ###
# Observation type. CHOICES: 'image', 'vector', 'cmvae'
obs: 'cmvae'

# Number of gymnasium environments to run in parallel
n_envs: 1

# If using image obs, declare desired output size of scaling function. NOTE this is DIFFERENT from cmvae img_res, which uses img_res contained in cmvae_config.
img_res: [64,64,3]

# Do we want to output the packet information and save images
debug_logs: False

# Set seed with arbitrary int so that can report with results this also sets the seed on the simulation
seed: ~

# Algorithm to import from Stable Baselines: 'sac', 'ppo', 'td3'
algorithm: 'sac'

# The path to the previously trained model. If running a training session, will train on top of this model, otherwise if running in inference mode will infer from this model.
